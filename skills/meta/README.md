# Meta-Skills

Skills about the skills system itself — knowledge management, agent behavior, and knowledge lifecycle.

**Difference from other categories:** the described object is not project code, but the knowledge management system itself.

**Important:** the `meta/` folder is excluded from `audit_skill_coverage` — there are no JS files here to cover.

## Subcategories

- **Skills system**: templates, lifecycle, granularity, language policy
- **Code linkage**: anchors, header links, code-loop
- **Agent behavior**: commands, orchestration, self-correction, context
- **Documentation**: levels, style, updates
- **System evolution**: pipeline, watcher, curation, migration
