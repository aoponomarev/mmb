# MMB Scripts Layout Rule

## Critical Rule
When creating or moving scripts, preserve layout governance:

1. `scripts/` root is reserved for:
   - `README.md`
   - manual user-entry scripts only.
2. Internal automation scripts must be placed in:
   - `scripts/infrastructure/`
   - `scripts/architecture/`
3. Preflight and git hygiene scripts belong to `scripts/infrastructure/`.
4. If scripts layout changes, update:
   - `scripts/README.md`
   - skill `scripts-layout-governance`
