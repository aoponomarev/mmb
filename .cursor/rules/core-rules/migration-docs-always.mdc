# MMB Migration Documentation Protocol (Zero Divergence)

## Critical Rule
During the MBB -> MMB migration phase, you MUST immediately document any completed step, architectural decision, or migrated skill. **Never end your turn** without updating the relevant tracking documents if you performed a migration task. Fact must always match the plan.

Apply in tandem with skill: `plans-sync-governance`.
Status transitions must be synchronized as `completed` / `changed` / `replaced`.

## Mandatory Target Files to Update:

1. **`skills/MIGRATION.md`** 
   - **Trigger:** Immediately after migrating any skill.
   - **Action:** Change `[ ]` to `[x]` for the specific skill and update the total counts at the top of the file.

2. **`docs/` (All files, specifically `План_MBB_to_MMB.md` and `План_Skills_MCP.md`)**
   - **Trigger:** Immediately upon completing a high-level task, script migration, or architectural setup.
   - **Action:** Mark checkboxes `[x]`, add new decisions, or cross out deprecated items (e.g., `~~old~~`).

3. **`skills/README.md`**
   - **Trigger:** If you introduce a new category folder (e.g., `security/`, `integrations/`) or change the structure of the skills folder.
   - **Action:** Document the new category or structure.

## Execution
Do not wait for the user to remind you. If you moved code, changed configs, or migrated a skill, your final tool calls in that turn MUST be `StrReplace` or `Write` to update these documents.
