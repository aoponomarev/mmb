# Skills MCP Protocol (skills-mmb server)

## Before Editing Any Code File

1. Check the file's JSDoc header for `* Skill:` references — read each referenced skill
2. Call `find_skills_for_file` with the file path to discover all skill links and inline anchors
3. Read the returned skills before making changes — they contain architecture decisions and known failure patterns

## When Encountering Errors

Before debugging from scratch:
1. Call `search_skills` with keywords from the error (e.g. "retry 429", "CORS", "path resolver")
2. Call `find_skills_for_file` on the file where the error occurs
3. If a skill documents the solution — follow it exactly

## When Introducing New Patterns

If adding retry logic, fallback branches, cache invalidation, merge/dedup, or error classification:
1. Call `search_skills` to check if an existing skill covers this pattern
2. If yes — follow the skill's protocol
3. If no — after the fix works, note it for skill creation (propose to `skills/meta/skill-pipeline.md` workflow)

## After Solving a Non-Trivial Bug

1. Record the solution in Memory MCP: `create_entities` with type `Solution_Pattern`
2. Add observations: what was broken, what fixed it, why it works
3. Link to relevant skill via `create_relations`
